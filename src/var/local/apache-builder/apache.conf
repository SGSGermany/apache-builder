#
# Virtual Hosts
#
# With the '$SITES' array you specify what virtual hosts to create. If empty
# or unset, it defaults to creating no virtual hosts. The '$SITES' array
# requires the following fields (separated by 2+ spaces):
#
# - Virtual Host: FQDN (e.g. 'sub.example.com')
# - Mode: Choose 'htdocs' (serving files from '/var/www/<virtual host>'),
#         'proxy', or 'redirect' (you must add an URL to '$SITE_URLS');
#         any other value yields 'none', denying all requests made
# - Owner: Owner of this virtual host (username)
# - SSL: Whether SSL should be used ('yes' or 'no')
# - PHP-FPM: Whether PHP should be enabled ('yes' or 'no')
#

SITES=(
    # Virtual Host  # Mode  # Owner  # SSL  # PHP-FPM
)

#
# Virtual Host aliases
#
# The '$SITES_ALIASES' array is used to tell Apache to answer to one or more
# additional FQDNs for a virtual host. If empty or unset, no aliases are set.
# The '$SITES_ALIASES' array requires the following fields:
#
# - Virtual Host: FQDN (must match the '$SITES' array)
# - Aliases: Space separated list of alias FQDNs
#

SITES_ALIASES=(
    # Virtual Host  # Aliases ...
)

#
# Virtual Host URLs
#
# The '$SITES_URLS' array is used for virtual hosts with modes `redirect` and
# `proxy` to tell Apache where users should be redirected to resp. what URL
# should be proxied. If empty or unset, no URLs are set. If a virtual host is
# configured to use `redirect` or `proxy` mode, but no URL is configured, it
# silently degrades to `none` mode that tells Apache to deny any request. The
# `$SITES_URLS` array requires the following fields:
#
# - Virtual Host: FQDN (must match the '$SITES' array)
# - URL: The URL users should be redirected to (mode 'redirect'),
#        or the URL that is proxied (mode 'proxy')
#

SITES_URLS=(
    # Virtual Host  # URL
)

#
# Default Virtual Host
#
# If the requested host is not known to Apache, Apache will serve the default
# virtual host as fallback. This default virtual host is no regular virtual
# host and is limited in its abilities on purpose.
#
# Use the '$DEFAULT_SITE_MODE' variable to switch mode for the default virtual
# host, either 'htdocs' (serving files from '/var/www/default'), or 'redirect'
# (set the URL to redirect to using the '$DEFAULT_SITE_URL' config). If empty
# or unset, `$DEFAULT_SITE_MODE` defaults to `"htdocs"`, `$DEFAULT_SITE_URL`
# defaults to setting no URL.
#
# Set '$DEFAULT_SITE_SSL' to enable (set to 'yes') or disable (set to 'no')
# HTTPS support for the default virtual host. Even though the certificate will
# most certainly be considered invalid due to the (expected) hostname mismatch,
# it allows you to have control over the certificate being presented. If empty
# or unset, defaults to `"yes"`.
#
# Note that the default virtual host neither supports 'proxy' mode, nor PHP.

#
# Virtual host httpdocs paths on the host system
#
# To specify a virtual host's httpdocs directory on the host system, you can
# either set the path in the '$HOST_HTDOCS_PATHS' array manually, or evaluate
# the '$HOST_HTDOCS_PATH_PATTERN' path pattern. A manually set path always
# takes precedence over a pattern.
#
# The '$HOST_HTDOCS_PATH_PATTERN' path pattern supports the placeholder
# variables '${SITE}' and '${SITE_OWNER}'.
#
# The '$HOST_HTDOCS_PATHS' array requires the following fields:
# - Virtual Host: FQDN (must match the '$SITES' array, or 'default')
# - Path: The absolute path on the host to mount inside the container

# please refer to the usage of the matching '$HOST_HTDOCS_PATHS' and

#
# User ID mappings
#
# For security reasons one should always create a user per virtual host on the
# host system and let this user own all files (httpdocs, logs, â€¦). Consequently
# any virtual host in the '$SITES' array should use an unique user. If the user
# chosen doesn't exactly match a user on the host, you must map them below.
# However, note that you must still specify 1:1 mappings, i.e. you can't map
# multiple container users to the same host user or vice versa.
#
# The '$HOST_UID_MAP' array requires the following fields:
# - Container user: Name of the owning user (must match the '$SITES' array)
# - Host user: The matching user on the host system (name or UID)
#
# Additionally the following users can be mapped:
# - apache2   (mapped to '$CONTAINER_USERNS' by default)
# - acme      (only if 'ssl' module is loaded)
# - php-sock  (only if 'proxy' and 'proxy_fcgi' modules are loaded)
